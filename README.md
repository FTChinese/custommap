# custommap

#Usage:
`node filtermap.js 'field=val1, val2, val3`

This will filter the world map data contained in `maps.js` to your needs.

Filtered data is written to a new js file named as `val1val2val3.js`, and the data was assigned to a variable of the same name.

Invoke file `val1val2val3.js` in you markup after highcahrts.js. Set `mapData` to `val1val2val3`.
